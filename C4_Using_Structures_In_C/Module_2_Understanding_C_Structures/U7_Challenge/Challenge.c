    We'll finish this chapter off with a challenge!

    Below, we have a table of some very notable names:

    Name            Known For               Country         Born            Died
    Johannes        Modern Printing         Germany         Jan             Feb
    Gutenberg       Press                                   1400            1468

    Elisabeth C     Women's Rights          USA             Nov             Oct 
    Stanton                                                 1815            1902

    Galileo         Physics                 Italy           Feb             Jan
    Galelei                                                 1564            1642

    Martin          The                     Germany         Nov             Feb
    Luther          Reformation                             1483            1546

    Your task is to build a struct datatype to represent these table entires 
    and store them as part of an array.

    Once you've done, try to re-order the items in the array so they take the
    following order:

    Name            Known For               Country         Born            Died
    Elisabeth C     Women's Rights          USA             Nov             Oct 
    Stanton                                                 1815            1902

    Martin          The                     Germany         Nov             Feb
    Luther          Reformation                             1483            1546

    Galileo         Physics                 Italy           Feb             Jan
    Galelei                                                 1564            1642

    Johannes        Modern Printing         Germany         Jan             Feb
    Gutenberg       Press                                   1400            1468

    The exercise answer will be in U8_Solution.
